* Components
- *Server*: For client to interact with the system, low computational process
- *Worker*: For performing scanning process, high computational process
- *Kafka*: For message broker
- *Postgres*: For database

* High Level Design

* Design Rationale
- Separating server with worker so client interaction does not get the burden of high computational process
- Message broker as a communication bridge between server and worker
- Relational database because the schema is well defined
